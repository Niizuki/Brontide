# Channel 0.2 design-foundation reviews

Status: four owner rulings resolved; four negative independent reviews retained; B1-B4, N1-N3,
F1-F3, and D1-D5 have correction passes and fresh independent totality closure review is pending.

This directory retains independent attestations for the complete Channel 0.2 first-batch design
foundation. A review is independent only when its reviewer identity differs from the design author,
it runs in a fresh isolated context at one pinned commit, and it has no access to the author's private
reasoning.

## Required review scope

The reviewer reads and assesses:

1. `Brontide-Architecture-Status.json` and the current Architecture 0.8 document, including its
   Complete Draft/non-ratified status;
2. both stacks' local Architecture 0.8 targets and public-boundary limitations;
3. the Channel 0.2 redesign plan;
4. retained Channel 0.1 design, contract, requirements ledger, 24 vectors, Portable Binding neutral
   schemas, and PB8 closure findings;
5. Decision 13 and its exact CM3/CM4 relational lifecycle requirements;
6. C1-C12, including every named scenario, capability-wide property, evidence mode, and explicit
   silence;
7. both state machines and all legal/illegal/terminal paths;
8. the closed state/event coverage grid, including every catch-all and late-traffic latch;
9. every responsibility-matrix owner and neutral crossing artifact;
10. the completeness review, including its residual risks;
11. every migration-ledger inventory and disposition; and
12. the neutral contract/vector brief and Batch 2 entry gate.

## Required verdicts

An attestation records:

- reviewer identity, reviewed commit, date, and isolation method;
- overall `conforms`, `conforms-with-nonblocking-findings`, or `does-not-conform`;
- one verdict and rationale for each C1-C12;
- session-state, interaction-state, state/event-totality, responsibility, completeness,
  migration-coverage, and neutral-brief verdicts;
- confirmation that each of the four resolved owner rulings is represented consistently throughout
  the first-batch design;
- every blocking and nonblocking finding with exact artifact/section evidence; and
- checks/probes performed, including at least one attempt to falsify a capability-wide property.

The reviewer writes only its requested attestation. It does not repair the design it reviews. A
blocking finding is corrected test/contract-first in a later commit and receives a fresh re-review;
the original negative attestation remains retained.

## Closure

Batch 2 may begin only after:

- architecture owners record the four first-batch rulings;
- every blocking review finding is corrected;
- a fresh closure attestation conforms at the corrected commit; and
- a small closure record pins the reviewed commit and attestation hash.

The author correction pass and ordinary documentation gates are not independent review.

## Exact next work

The next agent closes the first batch; it does **not** begin schemas or implementation.

1. Review the immutable correction pin
   `5cf42c4d97083324ffb8d6bd68491a145b8e611a` from a fresh isolated clone and a reviewer identity
   distinct from the author and all four retained reviewers. Read `AGENTS.md`, this policy, all four
   retained attestations, and every artifact in the required scope. Enumerate the complete
   session/initiator/recipient state-event grid independently, attempt to falsify at least one Cn-P1
   property, explicitly decide B1-B4, N1-N3, F1-F3, and D1-D5, and search for new blockers.
2. The reviewer writes only
   `channel-0.2-design-foundation-totality-closure-attestation.md`. It records the full pin,
   isolation, per-capability/area/ruling verdicts, retained-finding decisions, probes, and either
   `conforms` or exact new findings. It does not repair the design or create a closure record.
3. If the verdict is negative, retain the attestation unchanged, add failing verifier/model checks
   for each new finding, correct the design in a later commit, and obtain another fresh review. Batch
   2 remains closed.
4. If the verdict conforms, retain and commit the attestation unchanged, calculate its SHA-256, then
   create `channel-0.2-design-foundation-closure-record.md`. The record contains the reviewed commit,
   attestation path and hash, reviewer identity/date/verdict, all four owner rulings, confirmation
   that every retained finding closed with no new blocker, and the exact validation results. Update
   this README, the Channel index, the redesign plan, `docs/future/README.md`, and the design verifier
   so they accept exactly the conforming attestation and closure record and say Batch 2 is open.
5. Run, in order:

   - `build/verify-channel-0.2-design.ps1`;
   - `build/verify-channel-0.2-design.ps1 -NegativeProbe` and confirm it fails only because
     `C12-P1` was removed in memory;
   - `build/verify-doc-links.ps1`;
   - `build/verify-text.ps1`; and
   - `build/verify-interchange.ps1`.

Only after the conforming attestation, closure record, documentation/status updates, and clean full
gate are committed may the next agent start Batch 2 from the
[neutral contract brief](../Brontide-Channel-0.2-Neutral-Contract-Brief-0.1.md). This closure
authorizes planned schema work; it does not ratify Channel 0.2 or claim implementation conformance.

## Retained attestations

- [Original design-foundation review](./channel-0.2-design-foundation-attestation.md) — reviewed
  `66729b097b032febf498dd907dd2387e2aebc2c5`; `does-not-conform`; B1-B4 retained for closure
  comparison.
- [First closure review](./channel-0.2-design-foundation-closure-attestation.md) — reviewed
  `e863bf15fca30466d6e262b0ea66b3c05bc384eb`; `does-not-conform`; B1-B4 closed and N1-N3 retained
  for final closure comparison.
- [Final closure review](./channel-0.2-design-foundation-final-closure-attestation.md) — reviewed
  `1af7ba0018c874750e346ee687f07ea1d302adef`; `does-not-conform`; B1-B4/N1-N3 closed and F1-F3
  retained for definitive closure comparison.
- [Definitive closure review](./channel-0.2-design-foundation-definitive-closure-attestation.md) —
  reviewed `1b7c5fdea0dc555a64152eea055fcebad053cf90`; `does-not-conform`; all earlier findings closed and
  D1-D5 retained for totality closure comparison.

No conforming closure attestation exists yet. The corrected artifacts remain nonconforming evidence
until a fresh reviewer closes every retained finding and reports no new blocker.
