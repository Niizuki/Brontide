# Channel 0.2 design-foundation reviews

Status: four owner rulings resolved; four negative independent reviews retained; B1-B4, N1-N3,
F1-F3, and D1-D5 have correction passes and fresh independent totality closure review is pending.

This directory retains independent attestations for the complete Channel 0.2 first-batch design
foundation. A review is independent only when its reviewer identity differs from the design author,
it runs in a fresh isolated context at one pinned commit, and it has no access to the author's private
reasoning.

## Required review scope

The reviewer reads and assesses:

1. `Brontide-Architecture-Status.json` and the current Architecture 0.8 document, including its
   Complete Draft/non-ratified status;
2. both stacks' local Architecture 0.8 targets and public-boundary limitations;
3. the Channel 0.2 redesign plan;
4. retained Channel 0.1 design, contract, requirements ledger, 24 vectors, Portable Binding neutral
   schemas, and PB8 closure findings;
5. Decision 13 and its exact CM3/CM4 relational lifecycle requirements;
6. C1-C12, including every named scenario, capability-wide property, evidence mode, and explicit
   silence;
7. both state machines and all legal/illegal/terminal paths;
8. the closed state/event coverage grid, including every catch-all and late-traffic latch;
9. every responsibility-matrix owner and neutral crossing artifact;
10. the completeness review, including its residual risks;
11. every migration-ledger inventory and disposition; and
12. the neutral contract/vector brief and Batch 2 entry gate.

## Required verdicts

An attestation records:

- reviewer identity, reviewed commit, date, and isolation method;
- overall `conforms`, `conforms-with-nonblocking-findings`, or `does-not-conform`;
- one verdict and rationale for each C1-C12;
- session-state, interaction-state, state/event-totality, responsibility, completeness,
  migration-coverage, and neutral-brief verdicts;
- confirmation that each of the four resolved owner rulings is represented consistently throughout
  the first-batch design;
- every blocking and nonblocking finding with exact artifact/section evidence; and
- checks/probes performed, including at least one attempt to falsify a capability-wide property.

The reviewer writes only its requested attestation. It does not repair the design it reviews. A
blocking finding is corrected test/contract-first in a later commit and receives a fresh re-review;
the original negative attestation remains retained.

## Closure

Batch 2 may begin only after:

- architecture owners record the four first-batch rulings;
- every blocking review finding is corrected;
- a fresh closure attestation conforms at the corrected commit; and
- a small closure record pins the reviewed commit and attestation hash.

The author correction pass and ordinary documentation gates are not independent review.

## Retained attestations

  `66729b097b032febf498dd907dd2387e2aebc2c5`; `does-not-conform`; B1-B4 retained for closure
  comparison.

  `e863bf15fca30466d6e262b0ea66b3c05bc384eb`; `does-not-conform`; B1-B4 closed and N1-N3 retained
  for final closure comparison.
- [Final closure review](./channel-0.2-design-foundation-final-closure-attestation.md) — reviewed
  `1af7ba0018c874750e346ee687f07ea1d302adef`; `does-not-conform`; B1-B4/N1-N3 closed and F1-F3
  retained for definitive closure comparison.
- [Definitive closure review](./channel-0.2-design-foundation-definitive-closure-attestation.md) —
  reviewed `1b7c5fdea0dc555a64152eea055fcebad053cf90`; `does-not-conform`; all earlier findings closed and
  D1-D5 retained for totality closure comparison.

No conforming closure attestation exists yet. The corrected artifacts remain nonconforming evidence
until a fresh reviewer closes every retained finding and reports no new blocker.
