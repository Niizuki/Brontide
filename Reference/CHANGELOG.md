# Changelog

## Unreleased — CBI7 participant-set withdrawal

### Added

- Reference Studio revalidation of every participant of an admitted CBI6 set from fresh explicit
  CM5 requests, keeping the shared member released only when the identical set renews identically.
- Fail-closed retirement for membership change, identity drift, and any participant that does not
  renew, with the unrenewed participants named in the result.
- Shared withdrawal vectors pinning outcome kinds, codes, evaluated counts, and unrenewed counts,
  plus a phase-boundary completeness review.

CBI7 answers the question CBI6 deferred: partial loss retires the shared member rather than
narrowing the set, because nothing in an admitted set says which participants its ordinary
interaction depends on. It does not replace a participant in place, order participants, or
propagate revocation to another domain.

## Unreleased — CBI6 participant-set admission

### Added

- Reference Studio admission of a set of participants over one singleton binding, each with its own
  CM5 request carrying one `ComponentParticipant` relationship and one or more exact narrow grants.
- Cross-request rules the evaluator cannot see: distinct admission, relationship, and authority
  request identities across the set, and distinct receiving-domain Actors per participant.
- Shared participant-admission vectors pinning failure kinds, codes, evaluation counts, and
  aggregate grant counts, plus a phase-boundary completeness review.

CBI6 admits a participant set. It does not revalidate or withdraw one, order participants, exercise
a granted Operation, or model participants joining or leaving an active binding.

## Unreleased — CBI5 authority withdrawal

### Added

- Reference Studio revalidation of the exact CM5 relationship and grant behind one active CBI3
  binding, using fresh explicit time, evidence, and policy.
- Fail-closed retirement for revoked, expired, mismatched, or non-identical authority, plus shared
  withdrawal vectors and a phase-boundary completeness review.

CBI5 governs subsequent ordinary interaction for one singleton binding. It does not cancel
in-flight execution or provide distributed revocation.

## Unreleased — CBI4 integrated profile comparison

### Added

- An independent Reference Studio canonical profile for five CBI3 integration outcomes, covering
  complete CM5 parity, CM4 effects and failures, portable lifecycle, and stable plan facts.
- Shared exact profile digests plus the CBI4 capability contract and completeness review.

### Fixed

- Portable Binding Plan compact-identifier facts now use the lowercase portable identity-space
  tokens instead of CLR enum casing, matching the Minimal realization and wire vocabulary.

CBI4 is data-only comparison evidence, not integrated cross-process execution or general
substitutability.

## Unreleased — CBI3 authority-gated portable activation

### Added

- A Reference Studio coordinator that requires one explicit occurrence-to-Actor mapping and one
  exact CM5 `ComponentParticipant` relationship and narrow grant before CBI2 activation.
- Fail-closed shape, mapping, admission, and lifecycle outcomes that stop denial before provider
  contact and preserve later portable failure.
- Native authority-integration tests plus the CBI3 capability contract and completeness review.

CBI3 does not transport a Capability through Portable Binding or map a CM5 Operation to a portable
invocation. Withdrawal, multiple participants or grants, CM4 binding projection, relational or
multi-member activation, and general interoperability remain outside this slice.

## Unreleased — CBI2 portable lifecycle orchestration

### Added

- A Reference Studio coordinator for one CBI1 member and one singleton, protocol-free CM4 plan.
- CM4 preflight before provider contact, PB7-derived stage evidence, portable-refusal projection,
  and portable Release only after CM4 Active.
- Native lifecycle tests plus the CBI2 capability contract and contract-completeness review.

CBI2 grants no authority and does not support relational or multi-member activation, replacement,
child Ports, mediation, wider Provider Sets, or general interoperability.

## Unreleased — CBI1 Component Management / Portable Binding integration

### Added

- A Reference Studio composition-root adapter from one completed direct `1..1` CM2 provider
  position to PB7 preflight, using explicit CM definition/occurrence and portable
  Component/provider identities.
- Structured fail-closed outcomes for unresolved, wider, mediated, empty or multiple, indirect,
  identity-mismatched, invalidly addressed, and portable-preflight-refused positions.
- Native integration tests plus the CBI1 capability contract and contract-completeness review.

CBI1 prepares no provider, fixes no Binding Plan, grants no authority, and makes no real
interchange or Architecture 0.8 conformance claim.

## Unreleased — Component Management CM4 experimental evidence

### Added

- A deterministic fake activation Host over successful CM3 plans, with optional effect-free
  preparation, complete member-stage evidence, lifecycle and ordinary gate enforcement, one logical
  Release, and explicit cutover events.
- Exact scoped replacement with unrelated-scope preservation, retained-generation disposition,
  pre- and post-cutover failure, rollback restoration, rollback-unavailable degradation, and
  retained-generation corruption.
- Post-Release distinct and mediated binding observations with typed identity, provenance, routing,
  authority-check, delivery, and failure evidence, plus runtime-open child-Port and host-assisted
  activation ordering.
- The neutral CM4 vector inventory, phase-wide permutation and failure-silence properties, and the
  completed CM4 contract-completeness review.

CM4 remains a fake Architecture 0.8 experiment. It is not a package loader, production activation
host, process-isolation boundary, durable rollback system, or authority policy; CM5 owns authority
and admission.

## Unreleased — Component Management CM3 experimental evidence

### Added

- A deterministic, effect-free activation-group planner that partitions complete activation graphs
  into maximal strongly connected groups and orders the condensation graph dependency-first without
  inventing member startup order.
- Exact contract/version checks, finite lifecycle-protocol validation, Ready reachability and wait
  analysis, Region/Port containment, structured wider-parent and refusal outcomes, and explicit
  closed-gate Local Initialisation, Interconnection, Relational Initialisation, and Ready stages.
- The neutral CM3 vector inventory, phase-wide permutation and failure-silence properties, and the
  completed CM3 contract-completeness review.

CM3 remains fake Architecture 0.8 experimental evidence. Planning performs no preparation,
establishment, lifecycle execution, Ready reporting, Release, Actor or authority establishment, or
active-generation mutation; those runtime transitions begin in CM4.

## Unreleased — Component Management CM2 experimental evidence

### Added

- A deterministic, effect-free recursive resolver that closes finite acyclic selections into an
  inspectable Proposed Stack and immutable generation.
- Occupied-binding stability, preference/publisher/generic/other ranking, policy exclusions,
  lower-bound Provider Sets, explicit optional preselection, occurrence sharing, direct and mediated
  Binding Plans, child Port envelopes, topology decisions, post-closure Activation Parameters, and
  structured refusals.
- The neutral CM2 vector inventory, complete permutation properties, and the completed CM2
  contract-completeness review.

CM2 remains fake Architecture 0.8 experimental evidence. It does not prepare, activate, establish an
Actor, grant authority, mutate an active generation, accept cyclic groups, or claim conformance.

## Unreleased — Component Management CM1 experimental evidence

### Added

- Standard contract/version discovery across zero or more controlled fake sources, with complete
  source-endpoint and publisher attribution, deterministic ordering, duplicate claims, advertised
  package-version observations, and the source-neutral storefront projection.
- Immutable staged acquisition with attributable evidence and fake-policy decisions, four
  structured fail-closed refusal categories, source disappearance, and an explicit observation that
  CM1 performs no selection, resolution, preparation, activation, Actor establishment, or Capability
  grant.
- A separate neutral source/evidence-availability fixture, exhaustive enumeration-permutation
  properties, a falsifiable local/remote storefront comparison, and the completed CM1
  contract-completeness review.

This remains a fake Architecture 0.8 experiment outside Brontide Base. It is not a marketplace,
package manager, loader, security product, conformance claim, or component-version change.

## Unreleased — Portable Component Binding 0.1 experimental evidence

### Added

- `Brontide.Reference.Experimental.Binding.Portable`: the Reference realization of the Portable
  Component Binding contract under [`binding/portable/`](../binding/portable/README.md). It adds a
  deterministic-CBOR core and length-delimited framing, portable references and the Shape floor,
  contract negotiation and a frozen, inspectable Binding Plan, local authority under strong Kleene
  evaluation with frameless denial, referenced resources, an explicit lifecycle with declared
  limits, the Channel envelopes, the C9 observation set, and a fixed direct-call alongside a
  negotiated process realization. `PortableCoreAdapter` is the Reference-owned adapter between the
  stack's `ShapeValue` model and the neutral positions.
- `PortableCompositionHandoff` and `PortableCompositionMember`: the seam by which a resolved
  Component requirement and an offered provision produce a Binding Plan during activation preflight,
  with the ordinary-interaction gate closed until a composition releases the member. Provider Sets,
  mediated exposure, an unselected provider, and a provider substituted by the answering endpoint are
  refused rather than approximated.

The retained line-delimited Cooling and Catalog experiments in the same project are unchanged and
remain diagnostic and legacy. This surface is experimental architecture evidence: it is not part of
Brontide Base, not an Architecture 0.8 conformance claim, not ratified, and not a component-version
change. These repository projects are not independently versioned packages, so no version is bumped.

## Unreleased — Architecture 0.7 Complete Draft evidence

### Added

- `CanonicalMemberName`, `MemberKind`, and `MemberName` value types for the provisional typed-member
  grammar. Existing `CanonicalName` parsing and all current wire contracts remain unchanged;
  `MemberKind` stays open while the architecture's catalogue and final glyph are provisional.

This addition is current-draft evidence, not ratification and not a component-version change.

## Unreleased — Architecture 0.5 implementation correction

### Changed

- Failed dynamic Genesis callbacks now roll back their actors, capabilities, newly issued leases,
  pre-existing mutable lease state, declarations, and Shape registrations before rethrowing.
  Lease reads and renewal are coordinated with the domain transaction, rolled-back leases are
  actively invalidated, other escaped references are rejected after rollback, and runtime effects
  or nested Genesis occurrences cannot run reentrantly inside the transaction. Genesis-context
  activity validation and mutation are atomic, so a concurrent issuer cannot resume after rollback.
- Rejected provenance retains execution metadata but does not retain the submitted protected input.
  Direct `ExecutionResult` records remain complete; audit consumers may inspect `HasInput`.
- A liveness lease remains terminally dead after trusted time observes expiry, even if the supplied
  clock later moves backward.

These repository projects are not independently versioned packages. The provenance behavior is a
security correction to an experimental public surface; future package extraction must choose its
initial compatibility baseline explicitly.
